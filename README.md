Artillery Command is an artillery strategy game in the extreme early stages of development.

More updates as functionality is added -- check back soon!

Current game controls:

"projectiles" will come out of the "top" of the phone (hold in landscape, with screen facing you.  This typically puts the phone at a 45 degree angle in respect to the ground.  This then means that you are now shooting at a 45 degree angle. 

Power is calculated based on how long you hold the 'fire' button down.  The longer you hold it, the farther the projectile will go!


I realize that these instructions are extremely poor for a new player, so sorry for the confusion -- but I'm not really expecting (but I would be delighted to have) new players at this point in development!
